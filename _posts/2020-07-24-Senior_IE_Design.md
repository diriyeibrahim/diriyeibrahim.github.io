## Introduction

The concentration of the study is to optimize San Jose State Universityâ€™s waste management system and reduce their contribution to waste pollution issues in the community. The problems that are found in the system include; large amounts of plastic materials are thrown away; no infrastructure is provided to recycle or reuse the plastic materials; the waiting time to transport the plastic materials to the recycling center is long; a lack of data infrastructure; and, the recycling rate of SJSU Population is 30%.

### Waste Management Supply Chain Flowchart (Current State with 7 MUDA Wastes)

From inspection of the initial supply chain flowchart, it is apparent that there are various machines, supply chain partners, and people involved in the school's waste management system. One of our industry sponsors and notable system participant, GreenWaste, provided the team with data on which locations on the San Jose State University campus generate the most waste, what types of materials are sent to recycling or landfill, and the amount of truck arrivals per bin type collected. I defined metrics and units, organized, and cleaned up that data on excel before tabulating descriptive statistics and performing a design of experiments test utilizing Minitab and R to identify trends, variation, or factors of significance.

We narrowed our scope for the purposes of completing the project in a timely manner by focusing our efforts on one material type: plastics. From this analysis, the locations and bin removal frequency insights gathered from this data were used to help design and verify the effectiveness of the final solutions: a Makerspace Recycling Center at the College of Engineering, Spartan Gold Points System (Kg to Pts to Dollars), and an Educational Plan to change the recycling behavior of students. An average improvement rate of 96.61% was projected from a base case of 14,690 lbs (Total Amount of Materials to be Recycled per Day) when all designs are implemented via discrete event simulation mathematical modeling. If there are questions, I am more than willing to discuss other aspects of this project in more detail, feel free to message me!
