I studied industrial engineering, the science of optimization and improvement, due to it being at the crossroad between mathematics, engineering, and business. I am a certified six sigma green belt. My interests lie at the intersection of analytics and supply chain management utilizing technologies such as Excel, Minitab, Python, and R to identify large scale production and manufacturing problems.
